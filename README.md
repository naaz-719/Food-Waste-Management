# Food-Waste-Management

# Installed Packages: 
Set up Streamlit, Pandas, and Pyngrok in Google Colab to build the dashboard and make it accessible through a public link.

# Database Upload: 
Added the SQLite database (food_wastage.db) into Colab so the app could fetch provider, receiver, and food listing data.

# Streamlit App: 
Created food_dashboard.py containing 15 SQL queries to track donations, claims, and trends. Integrated tables, charts, and key metrics for better insights.

# Run in Colab: 
Launched the Streamlit app in the background and connected it with ngrok to generate a shareable public URL.

# GitHub Push: 
Uploaded the project files (app script, database, requirements.txt) to a GitHub repository for version control and sharing.

# Deployment: 
Deployed the app on Streamlit Community Cloud by linking the GitHub repo, selecting the main file, and letting Streamlit handle dependency installation and hosting.

# Live Access: Published dashboard is accessible at:
